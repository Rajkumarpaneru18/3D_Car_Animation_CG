## Description
The goal of this mini project is to create a dynamic 3D car animation using C++, OpenGL, and the glut library. Intricate wheel animations, day and night driving simulations, ambient fog effects, and fluid transitions in various directions are just a few of its primary characteristics. It also has a wide range of other intriguing animations. The project stresses interaction even more by including user input using tools like the mouse and keyboard, which makes it easier for users to get involved with and control the animation's many elements and eventually produces an engaging and visually appealing 3D vehicle animation experience.

## Implementation
This programÂ makes use of both standard OpenGL operations and the specifically designed processes described in the next sections. Understanding the nuances of automobile design and dynamic motion is a necessary step in the development process. The initial emphasis is on coding the various car modules, including the front end, body, windows, wheels, and silencer. Although a detailed code representation is out of the question for this article, a foundational overview of these coding elements is offered to serve as the project's starting point.


## Interaction
    mouse and keyboard interaction for the 3D car animation project:

Mouse Interaction

Right mouse button: Opens a menu with the following options:
Car model mode: Changes the mode of the car to either a standalone car or a car driving on a road.
Car driving mode: Changes the mode of the car to driving with and wihout wheel effect on a road.
Car colors: Changes the color of the car.


Keyboard Interaction

->esc - Exit from the program
->spacebar - Enter the main screen from start screen.
->x- Rotate the car in 'x' direction
->y- Rotate the car in 'y' direction
->z- Rotate the car in 'z' direction
->u- Camera top view
->f- Camera side view
->left arrow key - Move car in forward direction
->right arrow key-  Move car in backward
